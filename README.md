Welcome to this Spotify Web App clone, developed using NextJs, ReactJs, Tailwind CSS, Recoil, Atom, Middleware, Next-Auth, Framer Motion, and Spotify-Web-Node. This app fetches data directly from the Spotify API and requires users to log in with their Spotify accounts via Next-Auth and Middleware.

To enjoy the music-playing functionality, users must have a premium Spotify account and ensure that they keep a separate session of their account open while using the app.

For future development, we plan to integrate the Spotify Web Playback SDK into the Player component, add a Genius or Musixmatch API into the Lyrics component, create a homepage, add the ability to create playlists, and refactor the code.

We welcome contributions and bug reports from users, so please feel free to raise any issues you encounter.rcel!
