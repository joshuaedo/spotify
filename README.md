Welcome to this Spotify Web App clone, developed using NextJs, ReactJs, Tailwind CSS, Recoil, Atom, Middleware, Next-Auth, Framer Motion, and Spotify-Web-Node. This app fetches data directly from the Spotify API and requires users to log in with their Spotify accounts via Next-Auth and Middleware.

## Access to Created Playlists
This app pulls data from users' already created playlists on the real Spotify. This means that users can access and play songs from their existing playlists via the clone app.

## Why users need another session of their Spotify account
To use this Spotify Web App clone, users must have a separate session of their Spotify account open on any device while using the app. This is because the app fetches data directly from the Spotify API and requires a premium Spotify account to play music. By keeping a separate session of their account open, users can ensure that the app can access the necessary data to play music.

## Using the App
To use the app, click on the link and log in with your Spotify account. Ensure that you have a premium Spotify account and that you keep a separate session of your account open on any device. Play a song on that device and ensure that the tab remains open. You can then go back to the clone app and play any song from one of your playlists.

## Future Development
For future development, we plan to integrate the Spotify Web Playback SDK into the Player component, add a Genius or Musixmatch API into the Lyrics component, create a homepage, add the ability to create playlists, and refactor the code.
